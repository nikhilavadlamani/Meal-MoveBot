                The Meal & Move Bot is an interactive application designed to help users maintain a healthy lifestyle by offering personalized meal plans and yoga routines through an intuitive chatbot interface. Users can sign up, log in, and access a variety of meal and workout recommendations tailored to their needs. The chatbot provides recipe suggestions based on user preferences, such as ingredients, cuisine, and preparation time, leveraging the Spoonacular API for diverse meal options. Each recipe displays detailed information, including ingredients, procedure, and an accompanying image and URL. Users can mark their favorite meals with a star icon, which saves them to a personal profile page for easy access later.

The appâ€™s design focuses on accessibility and user convenience, allowing individuals to quickly find and bookmark their preferred meal plans and routines. This personalization is achieved through fine-tuned models that adjust recommendations based on user interactions, making the Meal & Move Bot a helpful companion for anyone looking to improve their wellness with minimal effort.
